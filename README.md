# Threadpool
In this project we implement a thread-pool mechanism in the C-C++ language </br>

This is a sample of how a threadpool works in linux. </br>
Our threadpool is implemented by using the maximum available resources for the cpu. </br>
In this program, we test a simple encrypt - decrypt files/input to see how threadpool makes the calcualtion faster. </br>

## How To Use

* clone the folder to a relevant workspace in linux </br>
* make sure you're in the right directory </br> 
* run the command "make/ make all" in terminal which will create the program to run. </br>
* inside the terminal where you created the outfile named "coder" execute - </br>
* ```./coder -d filename``` - decrypts a file and prints to stdout </br>
* ```./coder -e filename``` - encrypts a file and prints to stdout </br>
*  The same above can be done via a normal input and not necceraly needed a file.
